asking questions. I think one thing that's really
important is to not be afraid of your ignorance. <i>If
you don't understand how something works, ask
someone who does. A lot of people are skittish
about that. And that doesn't help anybody.</i> Not
knowing something doesn't mean you're dumbâ€”it
just means you don't know it yet.
