One thing that we're seeing now is that the Ajax
libraries are converging. <i>jQuery came up with
a notation for using CSS selectors for getting a
list of objects from the DOM and then providing
methods for manipulating the objects en masse.</i>
And that turns out to be a really good idea and
it's something that JavaScript does very effectively.
