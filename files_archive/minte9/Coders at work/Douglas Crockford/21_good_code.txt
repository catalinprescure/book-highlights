it's really difficult to write good code in a sloppy
manner. <i>By good code. I mean it's going to be
readable. At one level, it doesn't matter what it
does to a machine if I can't figure out what it does</i>,
so it might turn out that the code is amazing in
terms of its efficiency, or its compactness, or some
other metric which I don't care about.
