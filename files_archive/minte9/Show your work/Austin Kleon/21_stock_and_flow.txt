“Stock and flow” is an economic concept
that writer Robin Sloan has adapted into a
metaphor for media: “<i>Flow is the feed. It’s the
posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily
and sub-daily updates that remind people
you exist. Stock is the durable stuff.</i> It’s the
content you produce that’s as interesting in
two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s
what people discover via search.
