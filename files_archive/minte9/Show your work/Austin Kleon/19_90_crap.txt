Don’t worry about everything you post being perfect. 
<i>Science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon once said 
that 90 percent of everything is crap. The same is true 
of our own work.</i> The trouble is, we don’t always know 
what’s good and what sucks. That’s why it’s important 
to get things in front of others and see how they react.
