Designer Mike Monteiro says that the most
valuable skill he picked up in art school was
learning how to take a punch. <i>He and his
fellow classmates were absolutely brutal during
critiques. “We were basically trying to see if we
could get each other to drop out of school.”</i> 
Those vicious critiques taught him 
not to take criticism personally.
