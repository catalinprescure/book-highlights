The trouble with imaginative people is that weâ€™re good at picturing
the worst that could happen to us. Fear is often just the imagination taking a wrong
turn. <i>Bad criticism is not the end of the world. As far as I know, no one has ever
died from a bad review.</i> Take a deep breath and accept whatever comes.
