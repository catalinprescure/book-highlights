Don’t overthink it; just go with your gut.
If you’re unsure about whether to share
something, let it sit for 24 hours. Put it in a
drawer and walk out the door. <i>The next day,
take it out and look at it with fresh eyes. Ask
yourself, “Is this helpful? Is it entertaining?
Is it something I'd be comfortable with my
boss or my mother seeing?”</i>
