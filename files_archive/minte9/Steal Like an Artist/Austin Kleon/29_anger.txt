Anger is one of my favorite creative resources.
Some mornings, when I canâ€™t wake up. I lie in bed
and read e-mail and Twitter until my blood
starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring
out of bed. <i>But instead of wasting my anger on
complaining or lashing out at people. I try to
channel it into my writing and my drawing.</i>
