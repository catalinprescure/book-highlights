Other people I eventually figured out what
motivated them. One guy was really good at
tinkering and getting a prototype working. He
wrote sysadmin Perl. <i>He could wire stuff together,
write shell scripts, and write really bad Perl and
really bad C, but kind of get it working.</i> Then we
would be like, “Holy crap, you researched all this
stuff, you got all these components talking to each
other?”
