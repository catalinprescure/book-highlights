<i>I understand why people are frustrated with the
language. If you try to write in JavaScript as
though it is Java, it'll keep biting you. I did this.</i>
One of the first things I did in the language was
to figure out how to simulate something that
looked sort of like a Java class, but at the edges it
didn't work anything like it.
