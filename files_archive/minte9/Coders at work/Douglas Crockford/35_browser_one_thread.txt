<i>One of the things I like about the browser model is
that we only get one thread. Some people complain
about thatâ€”if you lock up that thread, then the
browser's locked up</i>. So you just don't do that.
There are constantly calls for putting threads into
JavaScript and so far we've resisted that. I'm really
glad we have.
