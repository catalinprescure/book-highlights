all be self-driven like me. <i>That was a learning
experience in HR, that some people just do what
they're told and don't really have a passion
for excellence</i>. They're just like, “Done. Next
assignment,” Or they don't tell you and just browse
the Web. So I had a couple of painful experiences.
But I think, after a year or two of that, I learned that
people are different.
