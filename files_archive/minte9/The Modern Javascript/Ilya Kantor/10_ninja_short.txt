<i>Brevity is the soul of wit.
Make the code as short as possible. 
Show how smart you are. If you write like that, 
a developer who tries to understand is going to have a merry time.</i> 
Then come to you, seeking for an answer. Tell them 
that shorter is always better. Initiate them into the paths of ninja.
(ninja code :)
