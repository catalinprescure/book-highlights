<i>A lot of programmers have the instinct of, “You've
got to present the error message!” No you don't.
No one cares about that.</i> That sort of stuff is
a lot easier to manage in languages like Java
that actually have an exception system. Where,
at the top loop of your idle state, you just catch
everything and you're done. No need to bother the
user with telling them that some value was zero.
