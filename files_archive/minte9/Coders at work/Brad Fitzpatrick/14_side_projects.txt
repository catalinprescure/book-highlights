Fitzpatrick: I often look for people that have done,
like, a lot of stuff on their own that wasn't asked
of them. <i>Not just their school project or just what
their previous employer had them do. Somebody
who was passionate about something and had
some side project.</i> How did they maintain it and
how serious did they get with it? Or do they do a lot
of quick hacks and abandon them?
