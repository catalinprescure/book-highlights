Then I really enjoyed reading code, because
whenever I didn't understand some pattern. I was
like, <i>“Wait, why the fuck did they do it like this?”
and I would look around more, and I'd be like,
“Wow, that is a really clever way to do this. I see
how that pays off.”</i> I would've done that earlier but
Iwas afraid to do it because I was thinking that if it
‘wasn't my code. I wouldn't understand it.
