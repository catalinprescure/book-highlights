<i>I had to force a lot of people to write tests, 
mostly people who were working for me. 
I would write tests to guard against my own code breaking, 
and then once they wrote code. I was like, “Are you even sure that
works? Write a test. Prove it to me.”</i> At a certain
point, people realize, “Holy crap, it does pay off,”
especially maintenance costs later.
