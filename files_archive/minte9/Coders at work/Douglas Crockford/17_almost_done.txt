I've managed projects where we're up against a
deadline and we had people saying, <i>“Yeah. I'm
almost done,” and then you get the code, and
there's nothing there, or it's crap, or whatever, and
they're nowhere close to done.</i> In management,
those are the experiences you hate the most and I
think code reading is the best way of not getting
trapped like that.
