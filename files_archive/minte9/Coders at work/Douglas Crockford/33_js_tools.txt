In Javascript there is much less need of formal tools like you
have in other languages. <i>The browser just wants a
source file, and so you send it a source file, and the
compiler is built into the browser, so there's really
nothing to do</i>. You don't have a linker. You don't
have a compiler. You don't have any of that stuff. It
just all runs on the browser.
