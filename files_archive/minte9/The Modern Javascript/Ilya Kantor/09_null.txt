<i>In Javascript the result of typeof null is object. 
That’s an officially recognized error in typeof, 
coming from very early days of JavaScript 
and kept for compatibility.</i> It is not a 
reference to a non-existing object or a null pointer 
like in some other languages. 
It’s just a special type which represents nothing.
