For a long time, JavaScript evolved 
without compatibility issues. 
New features were added to the language 
while old functionality didn’t change.
<i>That had the benefit of never breaking 
existing code. But the downside was that 
any mistake or an imperfect decision 
made by JavaScript’s creators 
got stuck in the language forever.</i>
