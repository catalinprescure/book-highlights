time. During the day, there's always something
coming up, like another meal is coming up, or a
class, or maybe you get a phone call. There's always
some interruption. I can't relax. <i>If I go into work
two hours before some meeting, that two hours is
less productive than if I didn't have that meeting
that day or if the meeting was the first thing in the
morning.</i> Knowing that I have nothing coming up
to bug me. I'm so much more relaxed.
