Some are purists. <i>They would just do abstraction
on abstraction on abstractions. <i>They would go
really slowly and are very religious about their
style. They're like, “I'm an artisan programmer.”</i>
And I was like, “Your code doesn't run. It's not
efficient and it doesn't look like any of the other
code that you're interacting with.”
