<i>Too many of us seem to believe that specializing
in something simply means you don’t know about
other things.</i> I could, for example, call my mother
a Windows specialist, because she has never used.
Linux or OS X. Or. I could say that my relatives out
in the countryside in Arkansas are country music
specialists, because they’ve never heard anything
else.
