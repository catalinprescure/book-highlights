Oh, yeah. I definitely try to find an
excuse to use anything, to learn it. <i>Because you
never learn something until you have to write
something in it, until you have to live and breathe
it.</i> It's one thing to go learn a language for fun, but
until you write some big, complex system in it, you
don't really learn it.
