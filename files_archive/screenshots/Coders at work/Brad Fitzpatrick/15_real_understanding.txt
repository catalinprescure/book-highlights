someone could teach you something and you're
like, <i>“Yeah, yeah, sure. I understand.” You delude
yourself but once you actually have to get down
and do it at a real level and understand all the
corner cases, it forces you to actually learn the
thing.</i> But I don't know if that would work for
everyone.
