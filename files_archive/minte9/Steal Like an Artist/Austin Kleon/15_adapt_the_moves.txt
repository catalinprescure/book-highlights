“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” <i>The
basketball star Kobe Bryant has admitted that
all of his moves on the court were stolen from
watching tapes of his heroes.</i> He realized he
couldn’t completely pull them off because he
didn’t have the same body type as the guys he was
thieving from. He had to adapt to make them his own.
