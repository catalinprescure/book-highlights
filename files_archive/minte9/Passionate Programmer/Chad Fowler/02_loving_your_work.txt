<i>If your life is primarily consumed by your work,
then loving your work is one of the most
important keys to loving your life.</i> Challenging,
motivating, rewarding work is more likely to make
you want to get up in the morning than dull,
average tasks. Doing your job well means that the
activity you do for 50 percent of your available
time is something you're good at.
