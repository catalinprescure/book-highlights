We're always being told find your voice. 
When I was younger, I never really knew what this
meant. <i>I used to worry a lot about voice,
wondering if I had my own. But now I realize
that the only way to find your voice is to use
it.</i> Itâ€™s hardwired, built into you. Talk about
the things you love. Your voice will follow.
