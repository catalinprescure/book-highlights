Some are purists. They would just do abstraction
on abstraction on abstractions. They would go
really slowly and are very religious about their
style. <i>They're like, “I'm an artisan programmer.”
And I was like, “Your code doesn't run. It's not
efficient and it doesn't look like any of the other
code that you're interacting with.”</i>
